# Perscepto - TerminalX Selenium Test Automation

This project is a demo of automation performance, adjusted to TerminalX

## Setup Instructions
 - Make sure to adjust dependencies in pom.xml of Selenium, TestNG and fasterxml
 - Make sure you have a stable, latest released version of chromedriver, adjusted to the driver's file path on your pc.

## Side Notes
 - The assignment took me 3 hours.
 - I hope writing in Java won't be a hassle, as implementing POM architecture is more natural to me in Java.

Thanks for the opportunity!
